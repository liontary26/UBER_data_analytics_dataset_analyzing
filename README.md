# UBER_data_analytics_dataset_analyzing
End-to-end Uber Data Analytics &amp; Machine Learning Pipeline — Data cleaning, EDA, demand forecasting, cancellation prediction, customer segmentation, and dynamic pricing analysis using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Prophet).
# 🚖 Uber Data Analytics & ML Pipeline

This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics and machine learning pipeline applied on an Uber dataset.  
The project covers **data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and multiple predictive modeling tasks** that provide actionable business insights for ride-hailing platforms.

## 🔎 Key Features
- 🧼 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: Handling missing values, categorical standardization, outlier analysis.  
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Temporal patterns, cancellations, ratings, ride distances, booking values, geographic trends.  
- 📈 **Demand Forecasting**: Hourly ride predictions using ARIMA and Prophet.  
- ❌ **Cancellation Prediction**: Logistic Regression baseline with potential for Random Forest / Gradient Boosting.  
- 👥 **Customer Segmentation**: K-Means clustering to identify heavy users, budget riders, occasional riders, and premium customers.  
- 💰 **Dynamic Pricing Analysis**: Regression modeling to predict booking value based on ride attributes.  

## 🚀 Business Impact
- Optimize **driver allocation** during peak hours.  
- Reduce **cancellations** through predictive insights.  
- Enable **targeted marketing** via customer segmentation.  
- Improve **pricing strategies** and revenue optimization.
